### What I learned

In the course of attempting this project, I learned how to access ```JSON``` data in JavaScript using the ```import``` declaration. I also accessed specific nested data in the ```JSON``` file using both the bracket and dot notation.

### Continued development

I want to learn more about accesing ```JSON``` data in different ways with JavaScript and in future projects, either with [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) or not, I look forward to working with ```JSON``` files.

### Useful resources

- [How to access nested json objects in JavaScript?](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-access-nested-json-objects-in-javascript) - This is one of the resource that helped me to know how to access items in a ```JSON``` file.
- [JavaScript Tip: Loading a Local JSON File without Fetch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z92PqSyUBSI) - This is also a good resource. It is a youtube video for those like me who better understand concepts through videos.
